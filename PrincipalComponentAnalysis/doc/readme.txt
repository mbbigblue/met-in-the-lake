Exercise 01
1. Generate random data
Problem looks like linear regression, but we are not going to predict y in next x. We want to discover relationship between x, y.
2. Use the PCA to find components and explained_variance(components" to define the direction of the vector, explained variance" to define the squared-length of the vector)
These vectors represent the principal axes of the data, and the length of the vector is an indication of how "important"

3. PCA dimensionality reduction means:
 - the information along the least important principal axis or axes is removed,
 - leaving only the component(s) of the data with the highest variance.
 - The fraction of variance that is cut out (proportional to the spread of points about the line formed in this figure)
  is roughly a measure of how much "information" is discarded in this reduction of dimensionality.
